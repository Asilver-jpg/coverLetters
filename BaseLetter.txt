Dear $C $R,

As a software engineer with two years of experience, I am excited to apply for the $P position at $C. $D. With these points in mind, I strongly identify with $C's mission to $M and I am confident that my skills and experience will benefit your company.

At Peer Supply, I built a custom Elasticsearch-based search engine for healthcare products, enabling users to discover inventory across different health systems. I also automated daily data imports with Airflow, ensuring inventory and approval processes remained up-to-date. Additionally, I optimized key query performance  by over 98%—cutting response times from 20 seconds to just 0.36 seconds. These experiences strengthened my ability to deliver scalable, high-performance backend systems.

Previously at Bundlefi, I contributed to both feature development and platform maintenance using Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Node. When the company underwent a rebrand, I helped re-architect the 8-year-old system using Vue, Node, and PostgreSQL, successfully delivering a new MVP and corporate site within five months.

Additionally, through my employment as the sole front end software engineer at Unshut, I created and assisted in the design of all of Unshut’s front facing applications. These included a home page that dynamically changes over time, a virtual file server that deletes itself over time, and a step-by-step meditation that is fully voiced with dynamic animations based on the frequency of those voice lines. In all of these projects, I had to overcome unconventional challenges with creative solutions.

At Logie, I built backend features for Amazon Live streamers, including a product recommendation algorithm, admin user tools, and role-based permissions. My focus is always on building robust systems that serve real user needs with clarity and efficiency.

Across all my roles, I’ve adapted quickly, learned new technologies independently, and delivered thoughtful, high-impact solutions. I’m eager to bring that same energy and dedication to $C's engineering team.

Thank you for considering my application—I’d love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to $C's mission.

Sincerely,

Alex Silver
